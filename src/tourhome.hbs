                    Old Havana Walking Tour
                </h2>

                <p>
                    Old Havana offers visitors one of the finest collections of constructions in the Americas. Its
                    stunning
                    four squares, interconnected by narrow cobble streets, depicts a time of colonial glory. Behind the
                    buildingsâ€™ renovated facades, you will find plenty of museums, art galleries, cafes and shops. Do
                    not
                    miss
                    the opportunity to get a taste of Cuba at the Chocolate Museum, or a souvenir at the Scent Museum.
